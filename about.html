        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
          I'm James Nanas, a dedicated student in the engineering academy at Wheaton High School with plans to pursue Mechanical Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park. I'm passionate about designing and building solutions to challenges in the automotive, aerospace, and aeronautics industries. I’m driven to expand my knowledge and push my skills further daily to prepare for real-world scenarios and projects.

        <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <p>Technical skills:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>CAD & Design: Fusion 360, OnShape, Revit, Multisim, KiCad</li>
          <li>Electronics: Microcontroller programming (Arduino), Integrated circuits (logic gates, 555 timers, flip-flops), soldering</li>
          <li>Coding: Python, C++, HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I have consistently used these skills throughout my engineering journey. Whether it’s for school, personal projects, or team projects, these skills have undoubtedly helped me become who I am today. The wide range of skills will also make it much easier for me to quickly learn necessary skills in the future.

        <h2>My Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Family is my greatest source of motivation. Hearing about my parents’ hard work and how they overcame the challenges they have faced has taught me the value of resilience and how to embrace the journey, not just the destination. Their determination has inspired me to bring my engineering dreams to reality. Whether it’s designing a jet engine, building a robot, or developing an AI assistant, I find joy in turning my ideas into a process of designing and building a working project from the ground up.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          Outside of engineering, I enjoy gaming, playing sports, building with LEGOs, cooking, baking, and spending time with friends. As most of my time has been spent working towards my engineering dreams, I’ve spent my free time trying many different hobbies and had all of them connect back to what I love most, engineering. Diverse hobbies, such as sports where I’ve played soccer, basketball, volleyball, badminton, and tennis, have built my abilities to work on a team and adapt to unexpected situations. Other hobbies, such as building with LEGOs, have made my creativity bloom and helped me work on my spatial reasoning. Altogether, these hobbies have significantly improved my abilities as an engineer.
